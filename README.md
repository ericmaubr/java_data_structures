# Java Data Structures

Welcome to the Java Data Structures repository.

This repository serves as my playground for developing and exploring well-known data structures, with a focus on deepening my understanding of Java Generics.

## Project Overview

- **Build System**: This project is managed with Maven.
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit is used for comprehensive testing. I aim to create thorough test cases for each data structure implemented in this project. Contributions and suggestions for tests are highly welcome.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Stack**: A classic LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. This implementation supports typical stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.

- **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. This implementation includes operations like `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek`.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions for improvements or additional tests, feel free to reach out. Your contributions will help make this project even better.
